    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Try this Detroit-style pizza recipe the next time you want a crunchy, crispy, cheese-laden slice! Detroit-style pizza is often referred to as a deep-dish pizza, but I don't think that accurately captures the essence of this crispy, crusty, crazy-good pizza. It has the flavor elements of a slightly charred thin-crust pizza and the texture of a light and airy focaccia.
         If you use a properly shaped pan, the edges of your crust get wonderfully crunchy, making for a truly unique experience.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>Dough</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup warm water</li>
        <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>2 Â½ cups bread flour</li>
        <li>3 teaspoons olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Sauce</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (24 ounce) jar marinara sauce</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Toppings</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>8 ounces shredded Monterey Jack cheese</li>
        <li>4 ounces shredded mild Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package thick pepperoni slices</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients</li>
        <li>Pour warm water into the bowl of stand mixer; mix in yeast and sugar and let dissolve.</li>
        <li>Add 2 teaspoons olive oil, salt, and bread flour. Knead mixture together with a dough hook attachment until dough is very smooth, soft, and elastic.</li>
        <li>Drizzle remaining 1 teaspoon oil onto a 10x14-inch Detroit-style pizza pan; use your fingers to spread oil over the bottom of the pan. Place dough in the center of the pan. Oil your fingers, then pull and stretch dough into a rectangular shape.</li>
        <li>Cover and let rise until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, make the sauce: Bring marinara sauce, oregano, red pepper flakes, and garlic powder to a simmer in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Simmer for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 525 degrees F (274 degrees C). Combine Monterey Jack and Cheddar cheese into bowl. Toss lightly to mix together.</li>
        <li>Finish the dough: Rub fingertips with some olive oil from the pan. Press out air from the dough while stretching and pushing it into a rectangle that goes all the way to the edges of the pan. Stretch dough up the sides about 1/2 inch or so.</li>
        <li>Lay almost all pepperoni slices onto dough. Scatter cheese evenly over top, making sure to fully cover all the edges where dough meets the pan.</li>
        <li>Ladle sauce on top in three long strips. Arrange remaining pepperoni slices over top.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until pizza is a bit darker than golden brown, about 15 minutes. Let cool for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Very carefully slide pizza onto a cutting board. Slice into rectangular pieces.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
